                      count on to tackle the most technically challenging stories in each sprint. I found him to be
                      quick

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Sanchit and me have worked together at Accenture, on very high visibility projects.
                      Although he joined as the youngest and newest member to my team, he grew to be a very valuable
                      member for the Responsive design legacy conversion project we were working on.

                      As a Scrum Master of a geographically distributed team, it is a challenge to emulate the level of
                      collaboration within the Scrum Team as proposed by Agile Principles.
                      Add to it, conflicting priorities and tight schedules makes it really hard to hold true to Agile.
                      Sanchit has on many occasions stepped up and taken initiative to pursue and resolve hard problems.
                      Be it process or technical.
                      He has proposed good ideas and creative designs that utilize latest technologies that eventually
                      got
                      implemented in the project.
                      He is called upon as the WCAG/PwD expert. Has proposed coding rules and component organization
                      that
                      we followed in the project.
                      I can rely on him to research on any topic and come back with creative solutions that we can use.

                      Sanchit is strong technically. He has good problem-solving skills. He is a Technology Evangelist.
                      A key quality that he has that i have seen lacking in most folks out of IDC, is his initiative. He
                      isn't afraid to get his hands dirty.
                      He is pro-active and is an active contributing team member. He communicates and works well with
                      others within the team and across teams.
                      He uses his knowledge and experience to help other team members.

                      Overall Sanchit had went over and above his current responsibilities and produced excellent
                      results.
                      If were to start a company or move to another project, you can be sure i would pull Sanchit along
                      with me. :)</p>

                      myLearning within Accenture. Sanchit joined the project as a developer while I was the Business
                      Analyst on the team. Working with Sanchit was extremely fulfilling. Sanchit is very hardworking
                      and passionate about the things he works on. He quickly scaled up from being a junior developer to
                      SME and then the lead developer within this tenure which also talks about the efforts he puts into
                      anything that is assigned to him and goes an extra mile to work on other side projects and
                      initiatives as well. He is a great communicator and doesn't just go with the flow but also asks
                      relevant questions to bring in clarity amongst all stakeholders. There were many occasions where
                      Sanchit donned on his problem solving hat for resolving issues and generating solutions
                      encountered during the design/build/test phase of the projects. Since the project followed the
                      Agile Scrum Methodology, Sanchit has well adapted to the way Scrum works, and was also able to
                      enable junior developers on his team to adapt to it, provide them guidance and help them in case
                      they encounter any roadblocks.

                      In summary, Sanchit is a great asset on the team and I wish him the very best for his journey here
                      on. It was a pleasure to have this opportunity to work alongside you :)</p>
